# boilerplate-cyclejs-rxjs

this is a boilerplate for **cyclejs** with **rxjs 5** (default is xstream)
also **live-server**, **watchify** and **babel** are included

## usage

1. clone repository and `cd` into it
2. `rm -rf .git`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start` -> afterwards your default browser should open 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'  with 'CycleJS with RxJS5 works!'
5. change code in index.html and src/app.js to your needs
